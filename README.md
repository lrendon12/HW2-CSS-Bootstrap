# HW2-CSS-Bootstrap
This homework was tougher than the first, obviously.

Started all 3 html pages from scratch. 

Added the nav bar in each and linked all 3 to each of the other pages

I added backgrounds to 2 of the pages and had issues making them stretch and expand thru the whole page .
I thought it was awesome when my links worked and i finally figured out what I was doing wrong to get the pages to load a background but couldnt figure out what I was doing wrong to have it use the whole page. 

added liks in my portfolio to the current homework and about me... the portfolio is pretty weak for now and added a couple of coming soon images so you know there is more to come. 

I struggle early on with bootstrap becaue I ended up on some other page and linked a completely different page in. Finally figured that out but cant make the backgrounds work properly yet. IF by chance they are working when you see them... it happened in the last few hours before homework was due.
